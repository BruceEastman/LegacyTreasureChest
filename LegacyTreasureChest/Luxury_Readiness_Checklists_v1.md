# Luxury Readiness Checklists (v1)

**Role in System**  
Readiness Checklists prepare an item or set for a **deterministic disposition path** (e.g., luxury hubs, specialty buyers, auction houses).

They are:
- Advisory, not blocking
- Informational, not evaluative
- Designed to reduce rejection risk and surprise

They appear **only in Execute Plan**, and **only for deterministic paths**.

```

Rules:
- No judgment language
- No implied blame
- Disclosure over perfection

# Luxury Clothing → Shoes / Boots
<!-- checklist_key: luxury_clothing_shoes_boots -->

### Pre-Hub Readiness Checklist (v1)

**Purpose**  
Prepare luxury shoes or boots for mail-in luxury hubs and reduce rejection risk due to condition issues that can be checked at home.

---

## 1. Sole & Heel Wear (Primary rejection reason)

☐ **Inspect soles for wear at toe and heel**  
Why this matters: Excessive sole wear is one of the most common rejection reasons, even for premium brands.

☐ **Check heel taps and edges**  
Why this matters: Uneven heel wear or exposed heel nails often lead to rejection or lower payout.

☐ **Note any resoling or repairs**  
Why this matters: Professional resoling can be acceptable, but it must be disclosed. Undisclosed repairs often result in rejection.

Guidance:  
Light wear is usually acceptable. Heavy wear, thin soles, or structural wear should be disclosed upfront.

---

## 2. Upper Condition (Leather, fabric, structure)

☐ **Inspect uppers for creasing, cracking, or scuffing**  
Why this matters: Creasing is expected; cracking or deep scuffs are not.

☐ **Check stitching and seams**  
Why this matters: Loose stitching or separation can indicate structural weakness.

☐ **Check toe shape and structure**  
Why this matters: Misshapen toes or collapsed structure reduce resale value.

---

## 3. Interior Condition & Branding (Authentication + wear)

☐ **Photograph interior brand stamp and size marking**

Guidance:  
Clear, honest photos improve acceptance rates and reduce back-and-forth.

☐ Original box  
☐ Dust bags  
☐ Proof of purchase

Why this matters: These rarely determine acceptance but can improve buyer confidence and payout.

---

## 6. Ready-for-Hub Assessment (Advisory)

Likely good candidates:
- Light to moderate sole wear
- Clean uppers with no cracking
- Clear branding and size
- No strong odors

Often better suited for alternate paths:

# Luxury Personal Items → Jewelry
<!-- checklist_key: luxury_personal_items_jewelry -->

### Pre-Hub Readiness & Decision Checklist (v1)

**Purpose**  
Help determine whether jewelry is better suited for a **designer jewelry hub**, a **local resale / auction path**, or a **materials-based sale**, and reduce rejection risk if a hub path is chosen.

Unlike watches or handbags, jewelry resale value often depends on **brand recognition, documentation, and buyer demand**, not original retail price.

This checklist is designed to support an informed decision before contacting any hub.

---

## Advisory Note (Read First)

Designer jewelry resale value often differs significantly from original retail price.  
Brand recognition, documentation, and current buyer demand typically matter more than original purchase cost.

Many jewelry pieces are better suited for **local resale or materials-based paths** rather than luxury mail-in hubs.

This checklist helps you decide.

---

## 1. Category & Intent Check (Decision Gate)

☐ **Identify whether the piece is designer-branded or materials-driven**  
Why this matters: Designer jewelry and materials-based jewelry follow different resale paths.

Designer signals include:
- Recognized brands (e.g., Tiffany, Cartier, Van Cleef, Bulgari)
- Named collections or iconic designs
- Original brand packaging or documentation

Materials-driven signals include:
- No recognizable brand or maker
- Value primarily in gold, platinum, or stones
- Broken, mismatched, or heavily worn pieces

Guidance:  
If uncertain, continue the checklist — clarity often emerges in later steps.

---

## 2. Materials & Metal Verification

☐ **Identify metal type if known (gold, platinum, mixed)**  
Why this matters: Metal composition affects both hub acceptance and alternate paths.

☐ **Locate and photograph purity or hallmark stamps**  
Why this matters: Stamps are required for verification.

☐ **Check for maker’s or brand marks**  
Why this matters: Recognized makers significantly affect resale options.

---

Why this matters: Damage materially affects value.

Why this matters: Loose stones are a common rejection reason.

---

## 4. Brand, Designer & Provenance

☐ **Confirm designer or brand, if applicable**  
Why this matters: Designer jewelry follows different resale paths.

☐ **Photograph logos, signatures, or serials**  
Why this matters: Supports authentication.

☐ **Gather provenance or receipts if available**  
Why this matters: Improves buyer confidence but is not required.

---

## 5. Condition, Wear & Integrity

Why this matters: Structural wear affects safety and resale.

---

## 8. Ready-for-Path Assessment (Advisory)

Likely candidates for designer jewelry hubs:
- Clear designer branding

- Functional closures
- Supporting documentation (if available)

Often better suited for alternate paths:
- No recognizable brand or maker

This separation often improves outcomes and reduces rejection risk.
